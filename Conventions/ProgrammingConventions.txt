Programming conventions:

-Writing everything in english

-Comments:
	Class javadoc:
	/**
	 * description
	 * @author: 
	 */ 

	// "text"

	/*
	 * text
	 * text
	 */

	/**
	 * text
	 * text
	 * author: author
	 */

	 always above the context that needs comments
	 always use javadoc with classes, fields and functions

Naming conventions:
	simple variables: camelCase starting with lower case
	class names: CamelCase starting with upper case
	Constants: all upper case, underscore multiple words

	public variables: camelCase starting with lower case
	private/protected variables: _camelCase starting with underscore, and lower case

	functions: camelCase starting with lower case

	always mention the scope (public private protected)

	getters and setters: get_variables (lower case), set_variables (lower case)
						 always on the end of the class

	constructor: always use the this keyword

	local variables: declare them when most needed

	braces {} : always at the same line of that block definition
				always use them (even with if's with 1 condition)

	try to avoid the use of static variables
